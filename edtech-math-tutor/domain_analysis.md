# Domain Analysis: EdTech Math Tutor

## ðŸŽ“ Domain Overview

**Domain**: Educational Technology (EdTech) - Mathematics Education
**Target Audience**: Students in grades 6-10 (ages 11-16)
**Primary Goal**: Provide personalized math tutoring through AI-powered assistance

### Domain Characteristics

**Mathematical Topics Covered**:
- **Grade 6-7**: Basic algebra, fractions, decimals, geometry basics, ratios
- **Grade 8-9**: Linear equations, quadratic basics, coordinate geometry, statistics
- **Grade 10**: Advanced algebra, trigonometry basics, advanced geometry

**Learning Challenges**:
- Students often struggle with step-by-step problem solving
- Abstract concepts need concrete explanations
- Common misconceptions in algebraic manipulation
- Difficulty connecting mathematical concepts to real-world applications

## ðŸŽ¯ Three Real-World Tasks

### Task 1: Concept Explanation
**Scenario**: A Grade 8 student asks: "I don't understand how to solve linear equations like 3x + 7 = 22. Can you explain it step by step?"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Break down the solution into clear, sequential steps
- Explain the reasoning behind each operation
- Use simple language appropriate for the grade level
- Provide verification of the answer

**Success Criteria**:
- Student can replicate the process with similar problems
- Clear explanation of inverse operations
- No mathematical errors in the solution

### Task 2: Problem Generation
**Scenario**: A Grade 9 student requests: "Can you create a practice problem about finding the area of triangles that's not too easy but not too hard?"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Generate an appropriately challenging problem
- Include realistic measurements and context
- Provide the correct solution method
- Offer hints if the student gets stuck

**Success Criteria**:
- Problem difficulty matches grade level
- Includes real-world context when possible
- Solution is mathematically accurate

### Task 3: Error Correction & Guidance
**Scenario**: A Grade 7 student shows their work: "I tried to solve x/4 = 12 and got x = 3. Is this right?"

**Expected Behavior**:
- Identify the error in student's reasoning
- Explain why the answer is incorrect
- Guide through the correct solution process
- Reinforce the correct method

**Success Criteria**:
- Correctly identifies the mistake (should multiply by 4, not divide)
- Provides encouraging, constructive feedback
- Helps student understand the correct approach

## ðŸ§  Domain-Specific Considerations

### Pedagogical Principles
1. **Scaffolding**: Break complex problems into manageable steps
2. **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on "why" not just "how"
3. **Multiple Representations**: Use visual, algebraic, and verbal explanations
4. **Error Analysis**: Turn mistakes into learning opportunities

### Common Student Misconceptions
- Treating variables as objects rather than unknowns
- Confusion between area and perimeter formulas
- Incorrect order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
- Sign errors in algebraic manipulation

### Success Indicators
- Student can explain their reasoning
- Ability to apply concepts to new problems
- Reduced anxiety around mathematical problem-solving
- Improved confidence in mathematical abilities
