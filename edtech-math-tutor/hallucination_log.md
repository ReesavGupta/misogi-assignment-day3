# When the AI Gets Things Wrong

I'm keeping track of times when the math tutor gives incorrect or confusing information. This helps me understand what's going wrong and how to fix it.

## How I'm Recording Problems

Whenever I notice the tutor giving wrong information, I write down:

- **When it happened** - Date and time
- **What the student asked** - The original question
- **Which teaching approach was being used** - Direct, example-based, step-by-step, or self-reflective
- **What went wrong** - The incorrect response
- **What it should have said** - The correct information
- **How bad it was** - Whether this would seriously confuse a student or just be a minor issue
- **What type of error** - Math mistake, conceptual confusion, made-up information, etc.

## Problems I've Found

### [When I find issues, I'll record them like this:]
**Student asked**: [The question]
**Teaching approach**: [Which method was being used]
**What the tutor said wrong**:
```
[The incorrect response]
```
**What it should have said**:
```
[The correct information]
```
**How serious**: [Minor issue/Noticeable problem/Could really confuse students]
**Type of error**: [Math mistake/Wrong concept/Made-up information/Other]
**My thoughts**: [What I think caused this and how to prevent it]

## Looking for Patterns

### What I'm Watching For
As I collect more examples, I'll look for:

- **Common mistakes** that keep happening
- **Topics that cause the most problems**
- **Which teaching approaches** tend to make more errors

### How Different Approaches Mess Up
- **Direct teaching**: [What kinds of errors this approach makes]
- **Example-based**: [What kinds of errors this approach makes]
- **Step-by-step thinking**: [What kinds of errors this approach makes]
- **Self-reflective**: [What kinds of errors this approach makes]

### How Serious the Problems Are
- **Really bad errors**: [Number] times - these could seriously confuse students
- **Noticeable mistakes**: [Number] times - wrong but not devastating
- **Minor issues**: [Number] times - small errors with little impact

## How I'm Trying to Fix This

### Solutions I'm Working On
[I'll fill this in as I figure out what works]

### Improving the Teaching Prompts
[Specific changes I make to reduce wrong information]

### Double-Checking Methods
[Ways to verify answers before giving them to students]

## For People Testing This System

When you're evaluating the tutor, please flag anything that's mathematically wrong. Pay special attention to:

- **Wrong formulas or procedures** - Like saying the area of a triangle is base times height instead of half base times height
- **Made-up math rules** - Inventing procedures that don't actually exist
- **Calculation errors** - Getting the arithmetic wrong
- **Conceptual mistakes** - Misunderstanding fundamental mathematical ideas
- **Fake examples** - Making up problems or references that don't make sense

When you find errors, please rate how serious they are:

- **Really serious**: This could seriously mess up a student's understanding
- **Moderately serious**: It's clearly wrong but won't cause major confusion
- **Minor**: Small mistake that probably won't hurt anyone's learning
