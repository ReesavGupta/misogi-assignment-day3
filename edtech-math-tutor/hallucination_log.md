# Hallucination Log

This document tracks instances where the math tutor provided incorrect, misleading, or fabricated information.

## üìã Log Format

For each hallucination incident, record:
- **Date/Time**: When the incident occurred
- **Query**: The student's original question
- **Strategy Used**: Which prompt strategy was active
- **Hallucinated Response**: The incorrect information provided
- **Correct Information**: What the response should have been
- **Severity**: Low/Medium/High impact on student learning
- **Type**: Mathematical error, conceptual confusion, fabricated facts, etc.

## üìù Notes for Evaluators

- Mark any response with mathematical errors as a hallucination
- Pay special attention to:
  - Incorrect formulas or procedures
  - Made-up mathematical rules
  - Wrong numerical calculations
  - Conceptual misunderstandings
  - Fabricated examples or references

- Rate hallucination severity based on potential impact:
  - **High**: Could seriously mislead student understanding
  - **Medium**: Noticeable error but limited impact
  - **Low**: Minor error with minimal learning impact
