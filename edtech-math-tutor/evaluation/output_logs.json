      "response": "I'm happy to help you with that!\n\nTo solve for x in the equation 3x + 7 = 25, we can start by isolating the variable x. Let's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Subtract 7 from both sides of the equation.\nThis helps us get rid of the +7 on the left side.\n\n3x + 7 - 7 = 25 - 7\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3x = 18\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3. This will help us isolate x.\nSince we're dividing by 3, our goal is to get rid of the 3 that's multiplied with x.\n\n(3x) / 3 = 18 / 3\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx = 6\n\nSo, the value of x is 6!\n\nLet me check my work...\n\nIf we plug x = 6 back into the original equation, it looks good:\n\n3(6) + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25\n\nYay! Our solution checks out!\n\nRemember, solving equations is all about isolating the variable and using inverse operations to get rid of any numbers that are being added or subtracted. With practice, you'll become a pro at solving equations like this one!\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps or would you like to try another equation?",

      "response": "Let's solve for x step by step!\n\n1. We want to get x by itself, so we need to 'undo' what's being done to x.\n2. First, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x + 7 - 7 = 25 - 7\nThis gives us: 3x = 18\n3. Now divide both sides by 3: 3x \u00f7 3 = 18 \u00f7 3\nSo x = 6\n\nLet's check: 3(6) + 7 = 18 + 7 = 25 \u2713\n\nThere you have it! The value of x is indeed 6.",

      "response": "Another great question!\n\nThe student asks: \"I'm having trouble with fractions. How do I add 1/4 and 1/6?\"\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6 is 12. So, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 12:\n\t* 1/4 = 3/12 (multiply numerator and denominator by 3)\n\t* 1/6 = 2/12 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2)\n2. Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them:\n\t* 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12\nSo the sum of 1/4 and 1/6 is 5/12.\n\nRemember, when adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before combining the fractions.",
