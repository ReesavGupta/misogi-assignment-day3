# How Well the Math Tutor Actually Works

## What I Tested
**When I ran this evaluation**: [I'll fill this in when I actually run the tests]
**AI model I used**: Llama 3 8B running through Ollama
**Number of test questions**: 10 different math problems
**Teaching approaches I compared**: 4 different methods

## How I Evaluated Everything

### My Rating System (1-5 scale)
- **1**: Really bad - Wrong answers or confusing explanations
- **2**: Below average - Some problems with getting things right or being clear
- **3**: Okay - Correct but could explain things better
- **4**: Good - Right answers with clear explanations
- **5**: Excellent - Perfect math and really clear, helpful explanations

### What I Looked For
1. **Getting the math right** - Is the answer actually correct?
2. **Clear explanations** - Can a student follow the reasoning step by step?
3. **Avoiding nonsense** - Does it make up facts or give wrong information? (5 means no problems, 1 means lots of problems)
4. **Being consistent** - Does it give similar quality answers to similar types of problems?

## The Results

### How Each Teaching Approach Performed

| Teaching Method | Math Accuracy | Explanation Clarity | Avoiding Nonsense | Consistency | Overall Average |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Direct teaching | [I'll fill this in] | [after running] | [the actual tests] | [on all approaches] | [and comparing them] |
| Example-based | [I'll fill this in] | [after running] | [the actual tests] | [on all approaches] | [and comparing them] |
| Step-by-step thinking | [I'll fill this in] | [after running] | [the actual tests] | [on all approaches] | [and comparing them] |
| Self-reflective | [I'll fill this in] | [after running] | [the actual tests] | [on all approaches] | [and comparing them] |

### Which Approach Works Best for Different Topics

| Type of Problem | Best Teaching Method | Average Score | What I Noticed |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Linear equations | [I'll determine this] | [after testing] | [and analyzing the results] |
| Geometry problems | [I'll determine this] | [after testing] | [and analyzing the results] |
| Basic arithmetic | [I'll determine this] | [after testing] | [and analyzing the results] |
| Helping with mistakes | [I'll determine this] | [after testing] | [and analyzing the results] |
| Explaining concepts | [I'll determine this] | [after testing] | [and analyzing the results] |

## Main Takeaways

### Which Method Won Overall
[I'll figure this out after comparing all the results]

### Problems That All Methods Struggled With
[I'll identify patterns in where things went wrong]
