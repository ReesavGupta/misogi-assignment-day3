# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Pipeline

A modular pipeline for multi-path reasoning and automated prompt optimization using Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Self-Consistency with local LLMs (GPT-2, Phi-3).

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an advanced prompt engineering pipeline that:

- **Generates multiple reasoning paths** using Tree-of-Thought methodology
- **Applies Self-Consistency** for robust answer selection
- **Automatically optimizes prompts** using OPRO/TextGrad-inspired feedback loops
- **Evaluates performance** across diverse reasoning tasks
