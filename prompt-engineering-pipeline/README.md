# Advanced Prompt Engineering System

I've been working on this system that takes prompt engineering to the next level. Instead of just asking an AI model one question and getting one answer, this pipeline generates multiple different reasoning paths and then figures out which answer is most likely to be correct.

## What This Project Does

I built this to explore some really interesting ideas in AI reasoning:

- **Multiple thinking paths** - The system generates several different ways to approach each problem, like how humans might consider different angles before deciding
- **Self-consistency checking** - Instead of trusting the first answer, it compares multiple approaches and picks the most reliable one
- **Automatic prompt improvement** - The system learns from its mistakes and gradually gets better at asking questions
- **Comprehensive testing** - I can evaluate how well different approaches work across various types of reasoning problems

## How I've Organized Everything

Here's how the project is laid out:

```

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- Python 3.8 or newer
- A decent GPU (I've been testing with an NVIDIA RTX 2050 with 4GB VRAM, but other CUDA-compatible cards should work)
- PyTorch set up to work with your GPU

### Setting It Up

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd prompt-engineering-pipeline

# Install the required packages
pip install transformers datasets accelerate tqdm pandas torch

# Make sure your GPU is working
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

### How to Use It

The basic workflow is pretty straightforward:

1. **Set up your reasoning tasks** - Put the problems you want to test in the `tasks/` folder
2. **Run the pipeline** - Execute the main script and let it work through the problems
3. **Check the results** - Look in `logs/` and `evaluation/` to see how it performed
4. **Iterate and improve** - Use the optimized prompts for better performance on future runs

## How I Built This (Step by Step)

I broke this project down into manageable phases:

### Phase 1: Creating Test Problems ✅
I started by putting together a collection of diverse reasoning tasks - things like logic puzzles, math problems, and analytical challenges. I made sure to define clear criteria for what counts as a good answer and stored everything in a standardized format.

### Phase 2: Multi-Path Reasoning ✅
This was the core innovation - implementing the Tree-of-Thought approach where the AI generates multiple different reasoning paths for each problem, then using self-consistency to pick the best answer. I also built comprehensive logging so I could see exactly how the system was thinking.

### Phase 3: Automatic Improvement ✅
I created a meta-prompting system that learns from its mistakes. The system analyzes which prompts work best and gradually evolves better ways to ask questions. It's like having the AI become its own prompt engineer.

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Analysis ✅
Finally, I built a framework to measure how well everything works - tracking accuracy, reasoning quality, and improvement over time. The system generates detailed reports so I can understand what's working and what needs refinement.

## What Makes This Special

**Multiple Thinking Approaches**: Instead of just one answer, the system explores different ways to solve each problem

**Self-Improvement**: The prompts get better over time as the system learns from experience

**Detailed Tracking**: Every reasoning path and decision gets logged so I can understand the process

**Comprehensive Evaluation**: Both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis of reasoning quality

**Local Processing**: Everything runs on your own hardware using models like GPT-2, so your data stays private

## How I Measure Success

I'm tracking several key metrics:

- **Getting the right answers** - What percentage of problems does it solve correctly?
- **Quality of reasoning** - Are the logical steps coherent and well-structured?
- **Avoiding nonsense** - How often does it make unsupported claims or logical errors?
- **Continuous improvement** - Do the optimized prompts actually perform better than the original ones?

## What's Next

My development roadmap includes:

1. Expanding the task curation system with more diverse problems
2. Refining the Tree-of-Thought reasoning engine
3. Improving the prompt optimization feedback loop
4. Enhancing the evaluation framework with more sophisticated metrics
5. Running comprehensive end-to-end testing
6. Generating detailed performance reports and insights

## Working on This Project

If you want to contribute or modify this system:

1. Start by reading through the PRD.md file to understand the full scope
2. Follow the phased approach I've outlined
3. Make sure to maintain the logging and documentation standards
4. Test everything thoroughly before integrating changes
