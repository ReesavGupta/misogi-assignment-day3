# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Pipeline PRD

**Project Title:** Multi-Path Reasoning + Automated Prompt Optimization  
**Target Assignee:** Autonomous Agent / Developer Team  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-25  

## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a modular prompt engineering pipeline that:

1. **Leverages Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Self-Consistency** for multi-path reasoning
2. **Uses an automated prompt optimization loop** inspired by OPRO and TextGrad
3. **Targets structured reasoning tasks** (e.g., multi-step math, logic puzzles, code debugging)

## 📦 Problem Statement

Given a reasoning-intensive task, the pipeline should:

1. Generate multiple reasoning paths using GPT-2 locally
2. Select answers via self-consistent aggregation
3. Detect performance gaps
4. Automatically generate multiple improved prompt variants
5. Enable human-in-the-loop review of hallucinations and refinements

## 🛠️ Tasks & Deliverables

### ✅ Part 1: Domain & Task Selection

**Goal:** Curate 5–7 reasoning tasks across domains.

**Implementation:**
- Store in `tasks/` as `.json` or `.yaml`
- Each task must include:
  - Task ID
  - Domain (math, logic, code, etc.)
  - Problem statement
  - Expected solution
  - Evaluation rule (e.g., assert or scoring function)

**Example Format:**
```json
{
  "id": "math_001",
  "domain": "math",
  "problem": "A train travels 60 km/h for 1.5 hours and 90 km/h for 2 hours. What is the average speed?",
  "expected_solution": "81 km/h",
  "evaluation_rule": "exact_match"
}
```

### ✅ Part 2: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) + Self-Consistency

**Goal:** Implement ToT + Self-Consistency using local GPT-2.

**Instructions:**
- Folder: `src/reasoning/`
- For each task:
  - Generate 3–5 diverse reasoning paths
  - Structure each path as a tree:
    - Node = thought
    - Branch = alternate logic
  - Prune low-quality or redundant branches
  - Use Self-Consistency:
    - Apply majority vote or agreement
  - Log:
    - Tree paths
    - Final answer
    - Agreement confidence

**Output Example:**
```json
{
  "task_id": "math_001",
  "final_answer": "81 km/h",
  "reasoning_paths": [...],
  "consensus_score": 0.67
}
```

- Save results to `logs/reasoning_paths/{task_id}.json`

### ✅ Part 3: Automated Prompt Optimization

**Goal:** Optimize prompts automatically using OPRO/TextGrad-style feedback loops.

**Instructions:**
- Folder: `src/prompt_optimization/`
- For any underperforming task:
  - Trigger optimization loop
  - Use meta-prompting to generate 3–5 alternative prompts
  - Example meta-prompt: *"You failed Task X. Rewrite the original prompt to be clearer, more detailed, or better at eliciting reasoning."*
  - Store new prompts in `prompts/{task_id}_v{n}.txt`

**Requirements:**
- Each iteration versioned
- Optimizer generates multiple variants, not just one
- Save optimization results to `logs/optimization/{task_id}.json`

### ✅ Part 4: Evaluation & Reflection

**Goal:** Evaluate overall pipeline performance and prompt improvement.

**Folder:** `evaluation/`

**Metrics:**
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Task Accuracy | Percentage of correct answers |
| Reasoning Coherence | Manual or LLM-assisted review (qualitative) |
| Hallucination Rate | Manually annotated % of unsupported reasoning |
| Prompt Improvement | Accuracy delta before/after optimization |

**Deliverables:**
- `evaluation/results.json` (per-task scores)
- `evaluation/metrics_report.md` (aggregate results)
- `evaluation/reflection.md` (what worked, what didn't)

## 🔁 Pipeline Flow Summary

1. **Load task** from `tasks/`
2. **Generate reasoning paths** via ToT (GPT-2) → `logs/`
3. **Apply Self-Consistency** → select final answer
4. **Evaluate performance**
   - If low, trigger optimizer → propose N new prompts
5. **Rerun** from step 2 for new prompt variants
6. **Save all logs** + prompt versions
