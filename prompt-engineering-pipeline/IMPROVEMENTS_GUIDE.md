# How I Made the System Better

## What This Guide Is About

I ran into some serious performance problems with my prompt engineering pipeline, so I spent time figuring out what was wrong and fixing it. This guide explains all the improvements I made to address issues with model limitations, shallow reasoning, poor prompts, and unreliable answers.

## The Main Improvements I Made

### 1. Better Reasoning Setup
- **More reasoning paths**: I increased from 3 to 5 different approaches (gives more diverse ways of thinking)
- **Deeper thinking**: Went from 2 to 3 levels of reasoning (more thorough analysis)
- **Smarter generation settings**: Different temperature and sampling settings depending on the type of problem

### 2. Specialized Prompts for Different Problem Types
- **Geometry problems**: Focus on identifying shapes, getting measurements right, and using the correct formulas
- **Math problems**: Emphasize working through calculations step-by-step and setting up equations properly
- **Logic puzzles**: Structure the premises, logical rules, and conclusions clearly
- **Probability questions**: Identify what the sample space is and what outcomes we're looking for
- **Code debugging**: Systematic approach to finding and fixing bugs

### 3. Better Answer Extraction
- **Pattern matching**: Use regex to find numerical answers, units, and formulas in the AI's responses
- **Problem-specific extraction**: Different extraction strategies for different types of problems
- **Multiple backup methods**: If one extraction method fails, try others

### 4. Answer Verification System
- **Consistency checks**: Make sure answers are in the right format and reasonable ranges
- **Domain validation**: Check that units make sense, numbers are reasonable, and logic is sound
- **Nonsense detection**: Identify and penalize obviously wrong or made-up information
- **Confidence adjustment**: Lower confidence scores when verification finds problems

### 5. Smarter AI Generation Settings
- **Temperature control**: Lower values (0.6-0.7) for math and logic problems, higher for creative tasks
- **Nucleus sampling**: Adjusted top_p values to balance quality with diversity
- **Repetition reduction**: Prevent the AI from repeating the same reasoning steps
- **Better token selection**: Added top-k sampling for higher quality word choices

### 6. Automatic Model Management
- **Smart model selection**: Automatically choose the best model based on available memory and performance needs
- **Performance profiles**: Detailed assessment of what each model is good at
- **Optimized settings**: Different generation parameters for different models and problem types

## How to Use the Improved System

### Basic Usage with All the Improvements

```bash
# Run with the new improved default settings (5 reasoning paths, 3 levels deep)
python src/reasoning/runner.py --task geometry_001

# Run all tasks with the enhanced setup
python src/reasoning/runner.py --all --paths 5 --depth 3

# Test a specific type of problem with even more optimization
python src/reasoning/runner.py --domain geometry --paths 6 --depth 4
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Use a bigger model if you have enough memory
python src/reasoning/runner.py --model gpt2-medium --task math_001

# High-quality reasoning (takes longer but gives better results)
python src/reasoning/runner.py --paths 8 --depth 4 --task logic_001
```

### Testing the Improvements

```bash
# Run a comprehensive test to see how much better things got
python test_improvements.py

# Test specific aspects of the improvements
python test_improvements.py --test single    # Compare before/after on one task
python test_improvements.py --test domain    # Test domain-specific improvements
python test_improvements.py --test models    # Check model recommendations
```

### Checking Your System

```python
from src.model_config import ModelConfig

# See what your system can handle
ModelConfig.print_system_info()

# Get a recommendation for your GPU memory
recommended = ModelConfig.get_recommended_model(4.0)  # For 4GB VRAM
```

## What to Expect Performance-Wise

### How Bad Things Were Before
- **Getting answers right**: 0-20% (terrible!)
- **Making logical sense**: 45% (not great)
- **Making stuff up**: 50% (way too much)
- **Geometry problems**: 0% accuracy (completely broken)
- **Code debugging**: 7.1% accuracy (almost useless)

### What I'm Hoping for After the Improvements
- **Getting answers right**: 30-60% (depends on the problem type and which model you use)
- **Making logical sense**: 60-75% (much better reasoning)
- **Making stuff up**: 20-30% (still not perfect, but way better)
- **Specialized problem types**: 40-70% accuracy in areas I've optimized
- **Overall consistency**: Much better at giving answers in the right format

## How I Optimized Different Types of Problems

### Geometry Problems
- **What I focused on**: Identifying shapes correctly, extracting measurements, applying the right formulas
- **Answer formats**: Area (cmÂ²), length (cm), angles (degrees)
- **Quality checks**: Making sure units make sense and values are reasonable

### Math Problems
- **What I focused on**: Step-by-step calculations, setting up equations properly
- **Answer formats**: Numbers, mathematical expressions
- **Quality checks**: Making sure calculations are consistent and results are reasonable

### Logic Problems
- **What I focused on**: Identifying premises clearly, following logical structure
- **Answer formats**: Conclusions, true/false statements
- **Quality checks**: Making sure logic is consistent and follows from the premises

### Probability Problems
- **What I focused on**: Identifying sample spaces, counting favorable outcomes
- **Answer formats**: Fractions, decimals, percentages
- **Quality checks**: Making sure probabilities are between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%)

## When Things Go Wrong

### If Performance Is Still Bad
1. **Check your GPU memory**: Run `ModelConfig.print_system_info()` to see if your model is compatible
2. **Try more reasoning paths**: Use `--paths 6` or `--paths 8` to get better agreement between different approaches
3. **Go deeper**: Use `--depth 4` for really complex problems
4. **Upgrade your model**: Switch to `gpt2-medium` or `gpt2-large` if you have enough VRAM

### If You're Running Out of Memory
1. **Use fewer reasoning paths**: Lower the `--paths` parameter
2. **Use a smaller model**: Switch to `distilgpt2`
3. **Don't go as deep**: Use `--depth 2` for faster processing

### If the Quality Is Still Poor
1. **Check the problem type**: Make sure the task domain is specified correctly
2. **Verify prompt optimization**: Check if the system is using the right specialized templates
3. **Review answer extraction**: Make sure the patterns for finding answers work for your problem type

## What I Might Improve in the Future

### Potential Upgrades
1. **Better models**: Integration with Llama 3, Claude, or GPT-4
2. **Compressed models**: GPTQ/GGUF models that work better with limited VRAM
3. **Specialized training**: Fine-tuning models for specific problem domains
4. **Multiple model consensus**: Using several different models and comparing their answers
5. **Smart prompting**: Automatically choosing the best prompt style based on problem complexity

### Integration Possibilities
1. **API-based models**: Connect to OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude
2. **Local model tools**: Make it work with Ollama or LM Studio
3. **Cloud deployment**: Run on AWS or Google Cloud
4. **Better evaluation**: More sophisticated ways to measure accuracy
