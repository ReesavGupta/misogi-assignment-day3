  "problem": "Sarah is currently 3 times as old as her daughter Emma. In 12 years, Sarah will be twice as old as Emma. How old are Sarah and Emma now?",
  "expected_solution": "Sarah is 36 years old, Emma is 12 years old",
  "expected_reasoning": [
    "Let Emma's current age = x years",
    "Then Sarah's current age = 3x years",
    "In 12 years: Emma will be (x + 12) years old",
    "In 12 years: Sarah will be (3x + 12) years old",
    "Given condition: Sarah will be twice Emma's age in 12 years",
    "Equation: 3x + 12 = 2(x + 12)",
    "Expand: 3x + 12 = 2x + 24",
    "Solve: 3x - 2x = 24 - 12",
    "Therefore: x = 12",
    "Emma's current age: 12 years",
    "Sarah's current age: 3 × 12 = 36 years",
    "Verify: In 12 years, Emma=24, Sarah=48, and 48 = 2×24 ✓"
