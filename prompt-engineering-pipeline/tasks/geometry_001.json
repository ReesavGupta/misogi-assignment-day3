  "problem": "A right triangle has legs of length 5 cm and 12 cm. What is the area of the triangle, and what is the length of the hypotenuse?",
  "expected_solution": "Area: 30 cm², Hypotenuse: 13 cm",
  "expected_reasoning": [
    "Given: Right triangle with legs a = 5 cm and b = 12 cm",
    "Area of right triangle = (1/2) × base × height",
    "Area = (1/2) × 5 × 12 = (1/2) × 60 = 30 cm²",
    "For hypotenuse, use Pythagorean theorem: c² = a² + b²",
    "c² = 5² + 12²",
    "c² = 25 + 144", 
    "c² = 169",
    "c = √169 = 13 cm",
    "Verify: This is a 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple"
