  "problem": "This Python function should return the sum of even numbers in a list, but it has a bug. Find and explain the fix:\n\n```python\ndef sum_evens(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 1:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```",
  "expected_solution": "Change 'num % 2 == 1' to 'num % 2 == 0' to check for even numbers instead of odd numbers",
  "expected_reasoning": [
    "The function is supposed to sum even numbers",
    "Even numbers have remainder 0 when divided by 2",
    "Odd numbers have remainder 1 when divided by 2", 
    "Current condition 'num % 2 == 1' checks for odd numbers",
    "This means the function currently sums odd numbers, not even numbers",
    "Fix: Change condition to 'num % 2 == 0' to check for even numbers",
    "Test: [1,2,3,4] should return 2+4=6, not 1+3=4"
