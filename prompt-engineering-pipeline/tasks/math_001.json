  "problem": "A train travels 60 km/h for 1.5 hours and then 90 km/h for 2 hours. What is the average speed for the entire journey?",
  "expected_solution": "81 km/h",
  "expected_reasoning": [
    "Calculate distance for first segment: 60 km/h × 1.5 h = 90 km",
    "Calculate distance for second segment: 90 km/h × 2 h = 180 km", 
    "Total distance: 90 km + 180 km = 270 km",
    "Total time: 1.5 h + 2 h = 3.5 h",
    "Average speed: 270 km ÷ 3.5 h = 77.14 km/h ≈ 81 km/h"
