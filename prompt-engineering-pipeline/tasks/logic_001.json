  "problem": "On an island, knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. You meet two inhabitants, A and B. A says: 'At least one of us is a knave.' What are A and B?",
  "expected_solution": "A is a knight, B is a knave",
  "expected_reasoning": [
    "Assume A is a knight (tells truth)",
    "If A is a knight, then A's statement 'At least one of us is a knave' must be true",
    "Since A is a knight, for the statement to be true, B must be a knave",
    "Check: A (knight) + B (knave) = at least one knave âœ“",
    "Assume A is a knave (lies)",
    "If A is a knave, then A's statement must be false",
    "Statement: 'At least one of us is a knave' would be false",
    "This means both A and B are knights",
    "But A can't be both a knave and a knight - contradiction!",
    "Therefore: A is a knight, B is a knave"
