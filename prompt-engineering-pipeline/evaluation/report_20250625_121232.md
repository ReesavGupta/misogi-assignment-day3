## Results by Problem Type

| Type of Problem | Number Tested | Accuracy | Logic Quality | Made-up Info | Time Taken |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Code debugging | 1 | 7.1% | 45.0% | 25.0% | 23.45s |

## Results by Difficulty Level

| How Hard | Number Tested | Accuracy | Logic Quality | Made-up Info |
|------------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Easy problems | 1 | 7.1% | 45.0% | 25.0% |

## What I Think Should Be Fixed

1. The accuracy is really low. I need to make the prompts clearer and more specific about what I want.
2. The reasoning doesn't flow well. I should focus on getting the system to think step-by-step more systematically.
3. Code debugging is clearly a weak spot. I need to create prompts that work better for technical problems.

## Detailed Results

| Problem | Type | Difficulty | Accuracy | Logic | Time | What I Expected | What It Actually Said |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|-----------|------|----------|-----------|
| code_001 | code debugging | easy | 7.1% | 45.0% | 23.5s | Change 'num % 2 == 1' to 'num ... | __import__(1) |
