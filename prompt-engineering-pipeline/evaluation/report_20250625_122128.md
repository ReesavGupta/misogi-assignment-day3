**Created:** June 25, 2025 at 12:21 PM
**Problems tested:** 1

## Quick Overview

- **How often it got the right answer:** 0.0% (yikes!)
- **How logical the reasoning was:** 45.0% (still needs work)
- **How often it made stuff up:** 50.0% (this is a big problem)
- **How long each problem took:** 22.82 seconds on average
- **How much the different reasoning paths agreed:** 40% consensus

## Results by Problem Type

| Type of Problem | Number Tested | Accuracy | Logic Quality | Made-up Info | Time Taken |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Geometry | 1 | 0.0% | 45.0% | 50.0% | 22.82s |

## Results by Difficulty Level

| How Hard | Number Tested | Accuracy | Logic Quality | Made-up Info |
|------------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Easy problems | 1 | 0.0% | 45.0% | 50.0% |

## What I Think Should Be Fixed

1. The accuracy is terrible - it's not getting anything right. I really need to improve how clear and specific my prompts are.
2. The reasoning still doesn't make sense half the time. I need to focus on getting better step-by-step thinking.
3. It's making up way too much information (50%!). I need to constrain the prompts so it sticks to facts.
4. Geometry is clearly another weak area. I need specialized prompts for math problems.

## Detailed Results

| Problem | Type | Difficulty | Accuracy | Logic | Time | What I Expected | What It Actually Said |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|-----------|------|----------|-----------|
| geometry_001 | geometry | easy | 0.0% | 45.0% | 22.8s | Area: 30 cmÂ², Hypotenuse: 13 c... | (nothing useful) |
