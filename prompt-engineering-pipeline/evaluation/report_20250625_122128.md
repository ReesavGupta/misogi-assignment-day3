## Performance by Domain

| Domain | Tasks | Accuracy | Coherence | Hallucination | Avg Time |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| geometry | 1 | 0.0% | 45.0% | 50.0% | 22.82s |

## Performance by Difficulty

| Difficulty | Tasks | Accuracy | Coherence | Hallucination |
|------------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| easy | 1 | 0.0% | 45.0% | 50.0% |

## Recommendations

1. Overall accuracy is low. Consider improving prompt clarity and specificity.
2. Reasoning coherence needs improvement. Focus on step-by-step prompting.
3. High hallucination rate detected. Consider more constrained prompting.
4. Poor performance in geometry domain. Consider domain-specific prompt optimization.
