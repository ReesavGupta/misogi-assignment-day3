# What I've Learned from Testing the System
**Created on:** June 25, 2025 at 12:14 PM
**Based on:** 1 evaluation report

## Main Discoveries

### The System Really Struggles with Code Debugging
**What I noticed:** The system performs poorly when trying to debug code
**How confident am I:** Pretty confident (90%)
**The evidence:**
- Only got 7.1% of code debugging problems right
**What I should do about it:**
- Spend more time optimizing prompts specifically for code debugging tasks
- Try different prompting approaches that work better for technical problems
- Let the system think more deeply about complex coding issues

## Where I Can Make Improvements

1. Put more effort into the areas where the system is struggling most

## What I Should Work on Next

1. Focus on improving performance in the weakest areas
2. Try different prompting strategies that might work better for specific types of problems
3. Spend extra time making the code debugging tasks work better
4. Allow the system to think more deeply about complex problems
